Koala Holla
===========

Our fictional client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) is a non-profit dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. Our team was been hired to build a web app to handle their terrarium residents. 

This application is now available for your own koala relocation needs.

We used a node, express, and postgres stack to acheive this. Upon downloading this repository, you will need to perform ' npm install ' in the root folder. 

Due to our concern for the Koalas, we implemented an alert system on an attempt to delete a Koala from the database, due to this, it is also important to run ' swalert install ' to enable functionality of sweetalert, their documentation can be found here: https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/

Please see the 'koala_holla.sql' file for instructions on setting up the database you will need to make this database functional and integrate it properly to the application.
